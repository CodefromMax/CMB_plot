Don't know how to properly graph 545, 847 using healpy
Working on S2fft

working on s2wav:
error:
    s2wav.analysis(f, L, N, sampling = "healpix")
    The datatype of the default Healpy planck map array is f4
    Dtype >f4 is not a valid JAX array type. Only arrays of numeric types are supported by JAX.

    solution:
    !pip install jax
    import jax
    jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)
